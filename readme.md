simple cs2 aimbot and esp, for linux only.

> [!CAUTION]
> vacnet 3.0 seems to be better at detecting aimbot and wallhacks, so **do not** use aim lock,
> and play with a low fov to avoid bans. use visuals sparingly.

- clone the repository: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked`
- install cmake and a c++ compiler (should be preinstalled on most distros)

## running

## faq

### what desktop environments and window managers are supported?

it is tested on GNOME with Mutter, and KDE with KWin.
support for other (especially tiling) window managers is not guaranteed.
if in doubt, use either one of the two just listed.

### the overlay window/my screen is black

your compositor or window manager does not support transparency, or it is not enabled.

### the overlay shows up, but i cannot click on anything

the window could not be made click-through, which might be because of window manager/compositor support.

### the overlay does not show up

you window manager does not support positioning or resizing the window.

### the overlay is not on top of other windows

your window manager does not support always on top windows.
